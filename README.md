# Batch-Forecasting--Stage-1
Time series for batch ( multiple products)- How code gets scaled from in different stages.  
I will go through the different stages to scale up/ scale down a time series  problem
It helps someone to see how big problem is broken down into pieces and then scale it up.
Here the main goal is not to understand time series but to see how code gets developed or transformed.
Targeted at people going into coding field,
Look at the excel sheet attached to see different stages and how I have explained. 
Data is also given in the excel for you to practice. 
I will show stage wise development in each branch. 


This batch forecasting problem ( forecasting multiple time series)  is applicable in multiple industries
such as retail ( to forecast multiple products), entertainment ( to forecast traffic at multiple days, or hours)
government ( forecasting demand for different services at different times) and there are enormous applications.
